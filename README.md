# Conversions Script

This Java file was intended to be a script that I use in the command line
to quickly do conversions without having to open up my browser to use an
online tool. However, I also think it provides a good base for a web app
to showcase my tech skills, so maybe I'll reuse this code in a Spring Boot
app.

Regardless, I use this all the time to streamline my conversion calculations.
